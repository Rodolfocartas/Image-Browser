Simple AJAX/jQuery based image browser to use with the TinyMCE extension for Symphony CMS.

Version: 0.5 (2011-07-27)


------------
Requirements
------------

Server-side: working Symphony 2.2.x installation with TinyMCE extension.

User-side: modern, preferably non-MS web browser with JS enabled and a Flash 10.x plugin.

(see Notes below)


--------------
How to install
--------------

(1) Put the files somewhere inside the Symphony installation directory.

(2) Rename "config-dist.inc.php" file to "config.inc.php" end edit it according to your setup.

(3) Inside the TinyMCE extension directory find a file called "richtext_tinymce.publish.js" and modify it adding "file_browser_callback" setting to the TinyMCE configuration. It should point to a function like the one below:

function __showFileBrowser(fieldName, url, type, win)
{
	if(type == 'image)
	{
		tinyMCE.activeEditor.windowManager.open({
		  title : 'Image Browser',
		  file : '/url/or/path/to/imagebrowser.php',
		  width : 600,
		  height : 600,
		  scrollbars : false,
		  resizable : true,
		  inline : true
		  }, { 
		  window : win, 
		  input : fieldName 
		  });
	}
	
	return false;
}

You would probably also like to append the "relative_urls : false" setting to the TinyMCE configuration in order to prevent the conversion of image URLs into the "../../.." form.

More info: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/wiki.php/Configuration:file_browser_callback, http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/wiki.php/Configuration:relative_urls.

(4) Image browser can now be accessed by calling the "Insert/edit image" dialog from the toolbar and clicking the icon next to the URL field.

Notes
-----

May not work properly on all browsers. Should work properly on Opera 11.x, Firefox 3.x and Chrome.

There's a good chance it will work with earlier versions of Symphony (not tested).
